# Submission

## What I Did
1. Adding a GEMINI.md file to help Google's Antigravity. Make itself improve it's instructions and reasoning.
2. Adding a prompts.md file to document the prompts used
3. Adding a .agent/skills directory with necessary skills to improve the quality of the code generated by the AI.
4. Implementing a clean, modern UI with consistent styling using Reusable components (Radix)

## What I Would Do With More Time
- Adding a devcontainer for easy setup (Google's Antigravity is having issues with the current version https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79843471/when-antigravity-sidebar-view-for-dev-container-is-broken-how-to-open-a-conta)

## AI Usage

I have used Google's Antigravity to help me build this project. I started by checking the requirements at `CHALLENGE_DESCRIPTION.md` and then I started implementing the project. I used the prompts in `prompts.md` as a log of what I did. I also used the skills in `.agent/skills` to improve the quality of the code generated by the AI.
